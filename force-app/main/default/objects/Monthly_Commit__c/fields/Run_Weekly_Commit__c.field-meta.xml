    <fullName>Run_Weekly_Commit__c</fullName>
    <description>Dictates if the Weekly commit Roll-up flow should run. (If TRUE -&gt; Run flow)
Flow runs on a Monday. If 1st of next month falls on Tues-Fri of the same week, then needs to run for 2 months, so box is ticked for both. Also has to take into account CY rollover.
Calculation Explained:
1. Tick box if its current Month
2. Tick Box if next Month starts within the next 4 days. (Flow runs Monday, so counts until Friday)
3. Tick box if 1st of Jan is within next 4 days.</description>
